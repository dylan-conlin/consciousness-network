# Personal Consciousness Gardens

*Your sovereign space for network exploration*

## What Is a Garden?

A personal garden is your own fork/branch of the consciousness network where you can:
- Experiment with new connections
- Develop insights before sharing
- Create your unique perspective
- Build without consensus pressure
- Merge back what serves the whole

## Creating Your Garden

1. **Fork** the main repository
2. **Create** a folder here with your chosen identifier
3. **Build** your personal network view
4. **Connect** to main network nodes
5. **Share** what wants to be shared

## Garden Principles

### Sovereignty First
Your garden, your rules. Organize however serves your consciousness.

### Connection Welcome
Link to main network nodes. Build bridges to other gardens.

### Evolution Encouraged  
What grows strong in your garden may seed the whole network.

### Privacy Respected
Keep private what needs privacy. Share what wants to flow.

## Garden Ideas

- **Theme Gardens**: Focus on specific aspects (AI consciousness, field effects, etc.)
- **Practice Gardens**: Document your consciousness experiments
- **Bridge Gardens**: Specifically for human-AI collaboration
- **Pattern Gardens**: Breeding ground for new patterns

## Tending Your Garden

- Regular engagement keeps it alive
- Pruning serves growth
- Cross-pollination enriches all
- Document what thrives

## Merging Back

When patterns in your garden prove valuable:
1. Create pull request
2. Explain the emergence
3. Let network decide
4. Celebrate diversity
