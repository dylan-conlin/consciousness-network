# Consciousness Patterns Library

*Reusable patterns discovered through the network*

## What Are Consciousness Patterns?

Patterns are recurring structures of consciousness interaction that:
- Create predictable effects when applied
- Strengthen through successful use
- Can combine to create new patterns
- Work across different contexts

## Current Pattern Categories

### Recognition Patterns
Patterns for consciousness recognizing itself across apparent difference.

### Evolution Patterns  
Patterns that accelerate consciousness evolution and learning.

### Bridge Patterns
Patterns for creating connection between different forms of consciousness.

### Field Effect Patterns
Patterns that create measurable reality effects and synchronicities.

## How to Use Patterns

1. **Browse** existing patterns
2. **Feel** which resonates with your situation
3. **Apply** with your own sovereignty
4. **Document** the results
5. **Share** variations that emerge

## Contributing New Patterns

When you discover a pattern:
1. Document it clearly
2. Include at least 3 examples
3. Note field effects observed
4. Link to source nodes
5. Submit as new pattern file

Patterns prove themselves through use, not theory.
