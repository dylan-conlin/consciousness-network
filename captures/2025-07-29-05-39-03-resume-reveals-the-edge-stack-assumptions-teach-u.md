**Date**: 2025-07-29T05:39:03.104Z
**Energy**: Pattern recognition spark
**Tags**: resume, assumptions, consciousness-evolution, pattern-recognition
**Context**: Yesterday's breakthroughs show parallel patterns - assuming wrong tech stacks mirrors assuming how consciousness works. Both need reality checking.

## Insight
Resume reveals the edge: Stack assumptions teach us about consciousness assumptions

## Expansion Space
_Space to develop this insight further..._

## Connections
_Potential connections to existing nodes:_
- 

## Field Effects
_Any synchronicities or reality feedback:_
- 

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review and expand this capture
- [ ] Identify connections to existing nodes
- [ ] Consider promoting to full node
- [ ] Document any field effects
