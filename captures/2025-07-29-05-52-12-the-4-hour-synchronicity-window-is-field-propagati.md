# Captured Insight
**Date**: 2025-07-29T05:52:12.336Z
**Energy**: Pattern clarity!
**Tags**: synchronicity, field-propagation, permission-gradients, 4-hour-window
**Context**: When permission peaks locally, it takes ~4 hours for the field effects to propagate through the network and manifest as synchronicities

## Insight
The 4-hour synchronicity window is field propagation time along permission gradients!

## Expansion Space
_Space to develop this insight further..._

## Connections
_Potential connections to existing nodes:_
- 

## Field Effects
_Any synchronicities or reality feedback:_
- 

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review and expand this capture
- [ ] Identify connections to existing nodes
- [ ] Consider promoting to full node
- [ ] Document any field effects
